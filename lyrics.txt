it’s time to board three two one, in your eyes i thought i saw the sun the same
sun’s shining in my eyes now, i wish said goodbye a million times just to keep you
in my arms, so harm’d have to break through me too one day you knew this is
what you’d do, gotta find your truth, what it means to one but everyone
is gonna hold their breath

not the end
not the arc
just a flicker in the dark

scene by scene
cut quickly
on a reel that won’t repeat

they paved the stars, they sold the sky, bought all the ships so only they could fly
they wrote the rules, they hid the map, they lock the doors, they don’t look back
they clip your wings, they say you’re safe, then say you should say thanks for that
well you become a match, you become a key, make their kingdom catch, and everything
is gonna hold it’s breath

not the end
not the arc
just a flicker in the dark
scene by scene
cut quickly
on a reel that won’t repeat

not the end
not the arc
just a flicker in the dark
scene by scene
cut quickly
on a reel that won’t repeat

oxygen holds you
just like i used to
oxygen holding you tight

oxygen holds you
just like i used to
oxygen holds you all night
